# LeetCode & Competitive Programming

A collection of LeetCode and competitive programming practice problems.

## About

This repository contains solutions and practice problems that I work on as part of my competitive programming journey.

I started exploring competitive programming in October and have since participated in SWERC (Southwestern Europe Regional Contest), representing Università degli Studi di Genova as part of the first team.

## Purpose

This is a personal practice repository where I post problems I work through to improve my problem-solving skills and algorithmic thinking.
